  abstract  = "The most popular approaches for the simulation of dynamic
               systems in computer graphics are force based. Internal and
               external forces are accumulated from which accelerations are
               computed based on Newton's second law of motion. A time
               integration method is then used to update the velocities and
               finally the positions of the object. A few simulation methods
               (most rigid body simulators) use impulse based dynamics and
               directly manipulate velocities. In this paper we present an
               approach which omits the velocity layer as well and immediately
               works on the positions. The main advantage of a position based
               approach is its controllability. Overshooting problems of
               explicit integration schemes in force based systems can be
               avoided. In addition, collision constraints can be handled
               easily and penetrations can be resolved completely by projecting
               points to valid locations. We have used the approach to build a
               real time cloth simulator which is part of a physics software
               library for games. This application demonstrates the strengths
               and benefits of the method.",

  abstract  = "The physically-based simulation of mechanical effects has been
               an important research topic in computer graphics for more than
               two decades. Classical methods in this field discretize Newton's
               second law and determine different forces to simulate various
               effects like stretching, shearing, and bending of deformable
               bodies or pressure and viscosity of fluids, to mention just a
               few. Given these forces, velocities and finally positions are
               determined by a numerical integration of the resulting
               accelerations. In the last years position-based simulation
               methods have become popular in the graphics community. In
               contrast to classical simulation approaches these methods
               compute the position changes in each simulation step directly,
               based on the solution of a quasi-static problem. Therefore,
               position-based approaches are fast, stable and controllable
               which make them well-suited for use in interactive environments.
               However, these methods are generally not as accurate as
               force-based methods but still provide visual plausibility.
               Hence, the main application areas of position-based simulation
               are virtual reality, computer games and special effects in
               movies and commercials. In this tutorial we first introduce the
               basic concept of position-based dynamics. Then we present
               different solvers and compare them with the classical implicit
               Euler method. We discuss approaches to improve the convergence
               of these solvers. Moreover, we show how position-based methods
               are applied to simulate hair, cloth, volumetric deformable
               bodies, rigid body systems and fluids. We also demonstrate how
               complex effects like anisotropy or plasticity can be simulated
               and introduce approaches to improve the performance. Finally, we
               give an outlook and discuss open problems.",
